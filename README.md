# Unsupervised-Learning
Objective:
The objective of this assessment is to evaluate your understanding and ability to apply clustering techniques to a real-world dataset.

Dataset
Use the Iris dataset available in the sklearn library.

Key components to be fulfilled :

1. Loading and Preprocessing (1 marks)
Load the Iris dataset from sklearn.
Drop the species column since this is a clustering problem.
2.Clustering Algorithm Implementation (8 marks)
Implement the following two clustering algorithms:
A) KMeans Clustering (4 marks)
Provide a brief description of how KMeans clustering works.
Explain why KMeans clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
Apply KMeans clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualize the clusters.
B) Hierarchical Clustering (4 marks)
Provide a brief description of how Hierarchical clustering works.
Explain why Hierarchical clustering might be suitable for the Iris dataset.
Apply Hierarchical clustering to the preprocessed Iris dataset and visualize the clusters.
